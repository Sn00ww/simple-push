## General

I made this program to push only with one command and a formatted commit message

## Technical

I programmed this tool in ruby. It was the first time I used this language. I used the colorize library to add some colors in the terminal.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Sn00ww/simple-push
sudo gem install colorize
```

## Usage

```sh
sudo chmod +x push.rb
./push.rb
```
